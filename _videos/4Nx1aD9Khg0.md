“I’m Coming Out” performed by Jack Ryan ([https://music.apple.com/us/album/wherever-together-single/1368620446](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6S5Hvm59dl8))

A very special thanks to Vito Russo and the producers of "The Celluloid Closet", without whom the first part of this video would have been pretty much impossible.
